# HTML-Practice
Its always exciting the first time you try learning a new skill. Especially coding.However, if you have no practice, you forget most of what you learn. Therefore, at some point you realize that you need to practice what you have learnt. Otherwise you’ll forget all of it. That’s where projects come in. Projects are a good way to practice what you have learnt. And trust me you want to work on some projects. You can use the projects to showcase what you have worked on.As a newbie, choosing projects that match your current knowledge level can be daunting. You might choose a project. Then the project becomes too big to be accomplished with your currently know-how. At least, that’s what I have gone through on this learning journey. I have curated some projects that I have found that are appropriate even if your knowledge is limited to HTML and CSS only. These projects are available in popular learning websites where you will find additional information on what you will be tackling.
